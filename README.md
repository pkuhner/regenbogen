This page presents my "personal cloud" of self-hosted applications. It currently runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 and a custom mini-ITX server, backed-up by a 1 Gbit/s LAN network and a 1 Gbit/s FTTH uplink.

## Hosts

**Naming convention:** hosts are named in German after [colors of the rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROYGBIV) and the [Rainbow Books series of the US NCSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Series).

### Rot

Rot runs network-related applications alongside my ISP router. It mainly serves as a DNS resolver, ad-blocker and as an internet-facing gateway to services hosted on Gr√ºn.

- Raspberry Pi 4 4GB
- 32 GB SanDisk Ultra MicroSD card (Class 10, UHS-I, A1)
- Cooler Master Pi Case 40

### Gr√ºn

Gr√ºn houses my data on a Btrfs RAID1 filesystem and hosts my personal services.

- ASRock J4125-ITX (4 cores @ 2GHz)
- 2x4 GB DDR4-2400 Crucial CT2K4G4SFS824A
- 500 GB Samsung 860 EVO SSD (MZ-76E500B/EU)
- 3x8 TB shucked Western Digital Elements (1x WD80EMAZ and 2x WD80EDAZ)
- Fractal Design Node 304 (FD-CA-NODE-304-BL)
- Be Quiet! Straight Power 11 450W Gold (BN280)

## Provisioning and configuration management

Hosts are running Arch Linux and are provisioned manually:
  - Partitions setup
  - Network configuration
  - User creation and sysadmin software installation

The rest of their configuration is managed through Ansible.
